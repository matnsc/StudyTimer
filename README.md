StudyTimer is a Mozilla Firefox extension created to help you manage your studies and tasks using the Pomodoro Technique. Using this time management tool can boost your focus and prevent fatigue over long periods of working.

Simple and effective, StudyTimer follows the browser design language, giving a natural and modern appearence to the extension. It's UI is predictable and easy to use, with a few seconds you'll get used to how it works.

You can also use your own custom work periods, break periods and even the number of pomodoros per cycle you want.

## What is Pomodoro Technique?

Pomodoro Technique uses a timer to break down work into small intervals of 25-30 minutes separated by short breaks (3-5 minutes), each interval is known as a pomodoro. When you complete 4 pomodoros you have a longer break (15-30 minutes).

This time management method was created by the italian Francesco Cirillo, owner of Cirillo Consulting, in the 80's.  Francesco’s core focus has always been improving productivity and efficiency, by finding ways to achieve better results with less time and less effort. Francesco has worked at the forefront of the software industry for more than 20 years.
